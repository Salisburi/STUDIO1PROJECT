Fam this project is messed up ...

PageST3A task list

1. Configure basic HTML (wrapper, head meta information, footer) - Done
2. Add form and input/select + submit form option - Done
3. Test userInput form submit + send to contextParam variables - Done
4. Create methods based on queries - store results in respective objects â€”> return objects in arrayList
5. Create JDBC + arrayLists, run methods to store data into arrayLists
6. Iterate through arrayList to form table (PageST2A)

Notes:
Data calculated: Average Temperature across the time period from the starting year and the difference in average temperatures

Allow user to input into textbox, countryCodes to look up specific regions (will not affect global)

If statements to produce table depending on selected geographic region

*Filtering country results by temperature and population will only affect the geographic region of country (used to filter in SLQ queries)

Table Global:
GeoRegion Type | Year Range | AvgTemp | Difference in AvgTemp

Table Country:
GeoRegion Type | CountryCode | Year Range | AvgTemp | Difference in AvgTemp

Table State:
GeoRegion Type | Country Code | State | Year Range | AvgTemp | Difference in AvgTemp

Table City:
GeoRegion Type | CountryCode | City | Year Range | AvgTemp | Difference in AvgTemp

UPDATE 1: THIS IS THE BASIS OF THE QUERY FOR ALL THA TABLES ADSHLKSAHDLKASD
SELECT
  c.CountryCode,
  t.StartingYear,
  AVG(c.AvgTemp) AS AverageTemperature
FROM (
  SELECT
    CountryCode,
    CAST((Year / 10) * 10 AS INTEGER) AS StartingYear,
    AvgTemp,
    (ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY CountryCode ORDER BY Year) - 1) / 2 AS RowNum
  FROM CountryTempPopulation
  WHERE Year >= 1750 AND Year <= 2013
) t
JOIN CountryTempPopulation c ON c.CountryCode = t.CountryCode AND c.Year >= t.StartingYear AND c.Year < t.StartingYear + 20
WHERE t.StartingYear IN (1750, 1850, 1930) -- Replace with user-provided starting years
GROUP BY t.CountryCode, t.StartingYear;

This uses the CountryTempPopulation Table as an example - Change it for the other tables + add necessary filters
